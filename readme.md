 In our college there is lack of communication between the pass-out seniors and  current students of NIT Durgapur. So whenever a current final year student requires some help related to campus placement he/she has to contact the experienced seniors on messenger or personal chat. So i would like to build a portal from scratch so that every seniors could share their interview experiences and the questions that were asked during his/her  interview. They can also guide them to prepare very well for the upcoming campus interview.
